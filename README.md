# "Resolver" Pattern Example

An example of the "Resolver" pattern I wrote about [on my blog][1].

This is not supposed to be a shining example of how to make any Go project, this pattern may not 
_always_ work for you. I'm also not making this example to showcase how you handle other areas of a
Go service, e.g. logging, metrics, database access, so on.
